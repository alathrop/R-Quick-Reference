# Example of using the same x column with different y columns (and associated labels)
# in a plot, using the Map() function

## This code gives a first look at the predictor values vs the demand for bikes. 

# If you are not familiar with using Map() this code may look a bit intimidating. 
# When faced with functional code like this, always read from the inside out. 
# On the inside, you can see the ggplot2 package functions. 
# This code is contained in an anonymous function with two arguments. 
# Map() iterates over the two argument lists to produce the series of plots.
